## ✨ Why another RL library?
Most libraries hide the algebra behind high-level APIs. **RLMathToolkit** does the opposite:

| Goal | How RLMathToolkit helps |
|------|-------------------------|
| *See the math, not just the code* | Each algorithm is written to follow the textbook equations 1-for-1. |
| *Run the same experiments as the book* | Pre-built scripts in `bandits/experiments/fig_two_*.py` reproduce Figures 2.1–2.5. |
| *Learn incrementally* | The repo is organised **chapter-by-chapter**. Each chapter introduces only the code it needs. |
